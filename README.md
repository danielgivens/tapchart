# Background
The prototype was created as a demo to create an alternative to the paper roll chart commonly used in off-road motorcycle events and races. This digital version of the roll chart has been optimized for operating with a mobile phone and glove and is equipped with Service Worker storage API for remote situations. Essentially, once the roll chart is loaded it becomes locally stored and fully functional as long as the browser cache has not been cleared, meaning that the information will not have to be reloaded in the event that the device is restarted and there is no service.
