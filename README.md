# Instructions
 1. [Visit the GitHub Pages link for this project](https://danielgivens.github.io/tapchart/) and allow some time for all the roll chart images load. Note: the browser will cache a fully functional stored version so that the data won't need to download again in the event that the device is restarted without signal or crashes.
 2. Tap the highlighted step from the roll chart to continue to the next. Tap the undo button to revert a step.

# Background
I do not have a printer or a roll chart holder, but I do have a phone mount and coding skills, so I created this browser-based prototype as an alternative to paper charts. Due to the some inconsistencies in chart layout formats, this version requires the individual cells of the roll charts be saved out independently.
