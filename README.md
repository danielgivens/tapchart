# Background
The prototype was created as an alternative to the paper roll chart commonly used in off-road motorcycle events amd has been optimized for operating on a mobile phone with a glove in remote situations. Once the roll chart files are fully loaded in your browser then it also becomes locally stored to remain fully functional as long as the browser cache has not been cleared, meaning that the information will not have to be downloaded again in the event that the device is restarted and there is no service.
